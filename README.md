# Tamid


I chose the Stonks problem and solved it using dynamic programming. 
I had a hard time with implementing the function with arrays because I wanted to use a dynamically allocated array so I instead used vectors which was easier for me to implement. 
Enjoyed it because I had seen a similar problem in one of my classes so it was cool to implement a similar procedure for a different application. 

To run the program:
go into the directory where file is located 
g++ <name_of_the_file.cpp> -o <executable_name> 
so in this case:
g++ tamid.cpp -o hello 
and then ./hello 

if the -o flag isn't used then the executable name by default will be a.out (to run ./a.out)
