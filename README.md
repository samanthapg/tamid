I chose the Stonks problem and solved it using dynamic programming. 
I had a hard time with implementing the function with arrays because I wanted to use a dynamically allocated array so I instead used vectors which was easier for me to implement. 
Enjoyed it because I had seen a similar problem in one of my classes so it was cool to implement a similar procedure for a different application.
